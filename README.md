# Quick Start (1.0 Compatible)

Start with one of three item kits to jump start your Factorio experience. The kit can be selected in the mod config settings. 

Small:
A few belts, burner mining drills and plates.

Medium:
Construction Robots, Personal Roboport, Assembling Machines, Electricity, Car

Big:
Lots of Belt, Poles, Assembling Machine 2's, Logistic Chest (Request/Provider), Roboports, Logistic + Construction Robots and other stuff. 
This kit also unlocks all technologies required by the logistics system.

Forked from Pasukaru's mod because the 1.0 update of Factorio broke it.

# Developers

Build with gradle.

- `gradle build` builds the mod .zip file. The `version` and `modName` must match the one in `src/info.json`. Set then in `gradle.properties` or like `gradle build -Pversion="1.5.0"`
- `gradle clean` cleans up after a `build` by deleting the generated folders in the repo. This does not clean up after a `patch`, you have to do that yourself.
- `gradle patch` attempts to patch the mod in your `factorioModsDirectory` for easy testing. Make sure to set the variable in gradle.properties but don't make commits with this variable set! You could use `gradle patch -PfactorioModsDirectory="directoryhere"` instead.
